## About

Hi there, I want to note that I was unfamiliar with next.js until this assessment. That said, this took me more than 3 hours to complete.

## What's not complete

- Dynamic 'View Cart' button/component
- Qty Button in Cart View
- Image slider ui
- Mobile compatibility
- Tests

_Let me know if you have any questions!_
